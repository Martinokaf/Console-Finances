# Console-Finances
Financial Records for Profit/Loss account 

## Description

A weekly task called "Console Finances" demonstrates how to write code for examining a company's financial records. Writing JavaScript code to analyse the records and determine each of the following is my task. The calculations include total months, net total amount of Profit/Losses for the entire period, average of Changes in Profit/Losses, largest increase in Profit, and greatest decrease in Losses.

## Usage

The below list displays the actions taken to finish the task:
- In order to figure out the overall number of months, the iteration method is being used. However, the "for" statement tend to declare the variable [i] and also initialize it to [0]. After each iteration of the loop, it verifies that [i] is smaller than the array's size, executes the subsequent if statement, and increases [i] by [1].
- In order to determine the net total amount of profit for the entire period, the utilization of constants and iteration has to be considered.
- I created an array using constants to hold all of the loss values and constants to get the final amount, which was the total net amount of losses for the entire period. I utilised "Math.round" to get the final value rounded down.
- The use of constants, if statement and push is being applied in order to calculate the final amount of the Greatest Increase and Decrease
